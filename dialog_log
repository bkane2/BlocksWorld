14:18:20 USER: some gold for extracting structure example, i can find like contiguous groups of blocks. i can find groups of love that are like
14:18:30 DAVID:  you referred to something mentioned in a previous question, but i didn't catch what you said.
14:18:57 USER: cuz i tried to say we are all the blue box touching each other.
14:19:06 DAVID:  you are asking about some the blue block , but i didn't catch what it was.
14:19:49 USER: i guess the pro i could see why you would use pro. it's really weird way to analyze it. but as a placeholder for something that is going to be there later is fine principal. i don't really care how like each other will be far behind with like whatever. i don't know why i usually went with with double check.
14:19:59 DAVID:  you referred to something mentioned in a previous question, but i didn't catch what you said.

14:20:15 DAVID:  you think only the mcdonald's block is touching each other .
14:20:51 USER: a different way of writing because by using a determiner, you're not limiting yourself to one thing if you did an underscore other job pro, i guess you could have a plural like they but that almost seems to like five blocks or something, right?
14:21:00 DAVID:  you are asking about some blocks , but i didn't catch what it was.
14:21:05 USER: david the adulterer blocking now.
14:21:13 DAVID:  i apologize , i couldn't understand what you said .
14:21:17 USER:  david can you give us a minute?
14:21:25 DAVID:  sure, let me know when you want to continue.
14:21:27 USER: so now we will not try to answer all questions.
14:21:41 USER:  but doesn't have any advantages.
14:21:44 USER:  how that can be used anywhere like
14:21:47 USER:  my phone is like
14:21:50 USER: father has always the same.
14:21:53 USER:  structure
14:22:43 USER:  no matter what is like it is this subject like whether it's a plural or whatever each other in this form. like this doesn't add any extra flexibility. at least not from my standpoint. maybe like the type. that would probably be more flexible justin that with if you didn't eat underscore other you would have to basically give a special processing for the phrase each other. but in this case in some way you should be able to generalize this out of the meeting of each and the meaning of other sort of figure out what this means maybe from
14:22:45 USER: another
14:23:02 USER:  but it requires like feeling like like things that aren't that good when you say other when you basically you can use each to get their butt.
14:23:16 USER:  i think it's just that you in principle. you won't have to do special processing processing for other as an adjectives.
14:23:19 USER:  let's see, i think.
14:23:24 USER:  is processing of others are now going to be the same?
14:23:32 USER:  is that block going to be a bit more difficult because we like the same.
14:23:37 USER:  that is supposed to is kind of like wrapped inside of it. so it's easy to get like saying.
14:24:15 USER: father red blocks did i just get dreadlocks and i like check whatever is not here. so it's kind of you could rewrite this as each. the and then other. a and then the principal and you should be able to whatever that thing is should be at least with the sentences were going to be working with probably just the subject of a sentence may be in general. it'll be something more complicated.
14:24:26 USER: in fact, i think we should be anytime is going to be the subject.
14:25:08 USER: yeah, i know. she somes weird. if you try to force it to not be the subject. i'll try to see some like i met john at the park and saw each other. that somes terrible. will you have to say is i met john at the park and we we saw each other.
14:25:11 USER: i think it'll
14:25:27 USER:  i can't think of an example where it wouldn't be in the subject right now. so for now you can probably
14:25:32 USER: construction
14:26:01 USER:  oh, wow, how much did you do yesterday?
14:26:22 USER:  i'm so sleepy today. i don't know why i was but then i was fine because yesterday i set my alarm or i send my alarm an hour later cuz i realize i was so tired and i forgot to move it back today. so i'm feeling
14:26:35 USER: i left.
14:26:48 USER:  i haven't worked out.
14:27:02 USER:  so there for a little bit but like not really you're going to do by yourself.
14:27:12 USER:  that's also true this time by happy accident.
14:27:17 USER:  i thought you have all the stuff in there. like i never use it.

14:27:40 USER:  so then you can also put us.

14:29:19 USER: how's it different from the hell you just feel like you're going so slow cuz you have to if you're not pushing yourself you were going really slow.
14:29:31 USER:  like you're going just like a little bit faster than people are blocking. if you don't like yourself on a hill, right and that that point you're just like no, i'm just going to go faster.
14:30:03 USER:  and it helps is the alcazar other people there and i go competitive. so if there's someone that clearly doesn't block like good biker and they're going fast lanes like not acceptable. also, there's a thing where if you pass someone on a bike and they think there may be some time there is like going slow cuz you're feeling lazy and then you see someone pass you and they're only going a little bit faster than you and you feel competitive and you start patio switch means if i ever pass them when i try to pass them going way faster than them. so if
14:30:22 USER: ever get into position when going a little slower than someone like i don't want to be stuck behind them so i can deposit them. but when i pass them i start liking way faster than i would have so then i actually get some like real good exercise cuz i'm biking way faster than i would have otherwise
14:30:25 USER:  as is the only healer around here.
14:30:36 USER:  i'd like that many times to recreate seattle.
14:30:39 USER:  bible

14:32:06 USER:  but seattle
14:32:23 USER:  5/6 times that 10 times.
14:32:50 USER: there we go over now.
14:33:04 USER:  what above the steepness?
14:33:26 USER:  actually, i can be pretty exhausting like i remember biking over mount hope and i was like the ice it started. so even if i have to go up three times as long as it's very
14:34:51 USER: oh, okay.
14:35:11 USER:  blocks like a nice bike ride.
14:35:25 USER:  i hate biking it at night or not at night or friday evenings or terrible after work. everyone that i capitol hill is sort of like a party area.
14:35:32 USER:  uber's always drop people off on the bike lane. so as i'm going up a hill.
14:35:47 USER: i need to like weave in and out of the car lane. what's the average miles per hour?
14:35:52 USER:  biking downtown seattle. i feel safe.
14:35:58 USER:  here in rochester the speed limits
14:36:03 USER:  are there any cars around in seattle?
14:36:28 USER:  5 and 30 but most people are actually going slower than that because there's so many lights in so much traffic. so i guess i'm actually like in downtown. i can bike almost as fast as a car smells. oh nice, maybe not on the bike. i have here a little nicer. yeah, i can keep up with the bite with cars at least like a block or two.
14:36:48 USER: i find a new mustang races in a different way two block out for us to pay more attention to what's around you but there's less of a chance of like someone getting hit by cars going really fast are also isn't that like there aren't any cars block because there are that many cars a lot of the drivers are a little bit.
14:36:57 USER:  overeager till i get where they're going. like when i'm driving here there lots of times are people so rude like cut you off from the right side when i get into the lane that they wanted.
14:37:06 USER:  i like going fast enough for them as they like past you and yeah in a car, that's not so bad.
14:37:21 USER:  we went to the imperial beach bar job today, and then we're coming back avenue. i think you liked the roses.
14:37:37 USER: because people were doing they're going to go fast, but they're not
14:37:42 USER:  and usually there's no oncoming traffic so they can just drive around.
14:37:48 USER:  yeah, that seems like it'd be a bit better, but that if it's really boring you just wife into trees.
14:38:10 USER:  i got all my being in.
14:38:18 USER:  i guess are there lakes that are close enough like the finger lakes with little too far up it?
14:38:24 USER: driving or something.
14:38:30 USER:  play something like that would be a cool bike ride if it wasn't too far.
14:38:33 USER:  you can go to.
14:38:42 USER:  how many phones also yeah.
14:38:49 USER:  going to be a long bike ride. lisa isn't go to like the closest to me so i can feel.
14:38:53 USER:  how far is it?
14:39:02 USER:  so it's a long bike ride, but it's not.
14:39:13 USER:  there aren't that many pills there are still some it going up 518
14:39:28 USER: oh, you do go on the highway for a while. i don't know what the highway blocks like.
14:39:38 USER:  i have a wide enough.
14:40:12 USER: or maybe just an hour.
14:40:26 USER:  i wonder if they just have a thing that prefers if it's green.
14:40:30 USER:  and the lakeland
14:40:33 USER:  yes, i can do that.
14:40:46 USER:  true forms of the problem. you will only see like interesting things by the end.
14:41:17 USER: if you're up to going to menopause, let me know.
14:41:21 USER:  the weather people actually, maybe no.
14:41:28 USER:  it's not the problem. the problem is like people will start complaining coffee there.
14:41:32 USER:  12 miles
14:41:35 USER:  that's it to go to the other side of mendon ponds.
14:41:58 USER:  24 hour wi-fi on a 25 mile bike ride, and it was a lot of fun in hills.
14:42:08 USER: another really big hill
14:42:15 USER:  that was too much.
14:42:39 USER:  how to work it would you get on this bridge that goes across the lake and then when you come off of the bridge you have to go up the hill because they do the bridges on the water level from the water level up to like basically when you get off of the waters word of it is a hill. so then you sort of get up the hill and then user meet up with the highway and to meet up with the highway you end up having to go down.
14:42:53 USER:  cast the late but then there's a basic we were on an island portion. and then after the island fortune, you have to get onto the mainland portion again, so then you should have had an out all their tail when you get them.
14:43:06 USER: we turn right and the bail enforcement doesn't answer you have it held at the route that we had to take. there was a hill between us and where we needed to go.
14:43:33 USER:  can you put the frustrating radiculopathy like partnership like mount hope or bigger or i think a little bit smaller?

13:19:17 DAVID:  i apologize , i couldn't understand what you said .
13:19:21 USER: david can you give us a minute?
13:19:28 DAVID:  sure, let me know when you want to continue.
13:19:33 USER: so i just have this like
13:19:39 USER:  neither, can you let it be cool if like if you have any thoughts on?
13:19:59 USER:  cheap say anything above teaching this thing new qualities. like if i were to explain this thing like this is what this is what it means to be diagonal and then
13:20:39 USER: show it to me examples and then it can and it has that into a cab you larry. is that sort of thing for the car. we're working on it. so it's basically in the design and discussion stage. we're trying to figure out what we need for. this idea is to rely on a bunch of primitive concepts at the dollar store like lower-level concepts and then come by so for example
13:20:54 USER: what can moto a bunch of the simple truth revolt configurations like listing listing listing listing?
13:20:59 USER: library
13:21:46 USER:  multiple primitives expression for simple relations, like between a certain shapes like diagonal at shape and what not and we're going to try to use this library to constructor visitation form more complex options more complex asha like two sticks of the same height with the block on top of picture of both of them.
13:21:49 USER:  this will be an hour or so.
13:22:18 USER: the system is two stacks of the same height and we can figure out how to construct.
13:22:30 USER:  a different from what you explain? what kind of question
13:22:39 USER:  lincoln challenge question
13:22:44 USER:  generality the problem is that so currently
13:23:06 USER: you have two approaches to learning general neurology. however requires significant number of examples like a three or two short lord.
13:23:12 USER:  do you have like present multiple examples of said if you want to act you cancel?
13:23:17 USER:  scratched again
13:23:31 USER:  so the logical systems they can be taught with like one shot few shot learning. so this is the goal. you want to try to achieve a few shot learning.
13:23:35 USER:  generality
13:23:40 USER:  a large variety of different concepts
13:23:45 USER: okay.
13:23:48 USER:  are there any
13:23:55 USER:  are there any thoughts too? cuz i understand that like it seems like
13:24:16 USER:  to try to bring it out from like just blockin above different color blocks and to pick-a-part things that image would be difficult to do in tire on that pipeline or something, but
13:24:31 USER:  if the focus is on like the the general knowledge kind of formal logic, like epilog ask assessment of the things they can take from an image.
13:24:35 USER:  how how much?
13:24:42 USER: like are you guys trying to keep it all within the confines of like?
13:25:15 USER:  aristotelian logic or or are they completely because you think is the best for the problem is the price of a prepositional world. we have a continuous space like for example in essay.
13:25:25 USER:  another on a b right on starbucks twitter
13:25:30 USER:  that's still on right cuz this is still our state's please.
13:25:50 USER: continue is with all these things in the high-level loaded language the same the same state the same proposition is that block and then this is all so it starts two block like you're just giving it a training set, right?
13:26:16 USER:  well not exactly so that idea is that the blender spatial subsystem would handle all these variations general rules slightly course information to the reasoning and planning system.
13:26:25 USER:  it's kind of neat seem like how many sorts steps there are so there's
13:26:28 USER: and i guess
13:27:10 USER:  you're trying to use all these steps to kind of i would guess that like you're trying to use all the steps to kind of show that works, which is interesting like to hear you. say it and then which i guess did you guys like using like an open-source widely? why because basically plays on lamps for specify.
13:27:20 USER:  stick like speech to text speech to text.
13:27:28 USER: and then i would guess that like people who decides to make it easier for themselves.
13:27:37 USER:  and skip the physicality and just go right into what's in there are kind of like
13:27:46 USER:  the kind of just do it like i would guess that they're sort of doing a different thing at that point because the instalike if
13:28:09 USER:  if you can do it, but it's not tangible, then it's different you can do this.
13:28:15 USER:  certain tasks. they will still be there like planning the construction.
13:28:31 USER: understanding the language that stand between my systems and applications.
13:28:47 USER:  does the same old ass in the lab setting but i'm going to try to use them in real life. you know who plays this issues. that is so messy. so i don't think it's a good idea. what kind of like
13:28:56 USER:  block away from the problems of physical world around them like as best as you can.
13:29:06 USER:  it's a really interesting. thank you so much.
13:29:09 USER:  i
13:29:11 USER:  so
13:29:16 USER: would you be blocking for any like
13:29:24 USER:  oh, yeah.
13:29:28 USER:  like what would that?
13:29:34 USER:  what would i like you? like what would you will do?
13:29:48 USER:  okay, so there are multiple tasks. so let's see what you'll be more interested in working with like or 41.
13:29:50 USER:  so there are multiple tasks.
13:30:34 USER: there's a problem parsing. so for now we're using the custom custom build foster for the you left, but apparently
13:30:40 USER:  like definitely different variations of every friday. does it have to be
13:30:54 USER:  manually coded. that's why we cannot handle a bunch of different expressions. like you change the wording of a question a little bit. so there's that far bar scene.
13:31:00 USER:  actually this far
13:31:16 USER: heavily relies on what gene is doing? so he is working on like general ewell esparza right now that you'll never placed if you succeed. so we're going to release a blocks are with keyless system.
13:31:26 USER:  then there is
13:31:31 USER:  speech generation issue.
13:31:35 USER:  so right now it's relatively simple.
13:31:43 USER:  because for most of the questions that are like relatively standardized forms of the answer so you can
13:31:50 USER:  future moving towards
13:31:52 USER:  tutoring
13:31:55 USER:  system will be explained in the castle.
13:32:01 USER: and when you like make a mistake.
13:32:04 USER:  correct you.
13:32:08 USER:  is the set of commands or
13:32:17 USER:  malaysian all right now aaron
13:32:23 USER:  so that's something you might join.
13:32:32 USER:  bandera style of management
13:32:51 USER:  i can't right now did i block at the new with the something covered in metairie for this moment? this is the introductory readings face says hello.
13:32:56 USER: fashion
13:33:02 USER:  touching the starbucks
13:33:05 USER:  so we do.
13:33:10 USER:  what's your pronoun?
13:33:34 USER:  but again for the tutoring for previous stop before vacation.
13:33:40 USER:  pure penalty.
13:33:45 USER:  so now so
13:34:12 USER: spatial reasoning subsystem of specialization module
13:34:37 USER:  which will make the judgments above positioning and whatnot and communicate his back paws going to be using both ways either understanding what the description
13:34:51 USER: i'm so messed up right now.
13:34:54 USER:  play if i were to put something.
13:35:04 USER:  yeah, you are.
13:35:06 USER:  yeah.
13:35:50 USER: i'm trying to fool the system.
13:35:58 USER:  why does it have trouble with the?
13:36:01 USER:  like the bit.
13:36:31 USER:  like calibrate like every few seconds it does but the problem is that the volkswagen system is not super precise. so it doesn't really know the block identities. so every like a few times a second you just scan of the table and extracts older block positions, but it doesn't know which one
13:36:41 USER: did you just tells you like? okay, there's a block at the point 0 0 2.
13:36:44 USER:  like block at that.
13:37:09 USER:  i can order to start asking questions like you need to know that this specific to some hacking to enable that yeah, but it's noisy.
13:37:17 USER:  okay.
13:37:26 USER:  is behind sort of
13:37:29 USER: but
13:38:17 USER: oh, i think it's because you're moving.
13:38:25 USER: it's like when you create the background like
13:38:32 USER:  you and blocks and the camera. so camera starts messing up the pool address and stuff.
13:39:48 USER: what did you want to do? what do you want to do with the blocks? i was just trying to see like if i put one out of you like above of you of what sort of.
13:39:51 USER: registers is happening.
13:40:04 USER:  so i was so it should be still there because if the block so i can
13:40:11 USER:  is that too kind of?
13:40:25 USER: accounts / lake possible noise with the connect systems. yes. yes.

=============================================================
13:41:11 DAVID:  hi, my name is david. i'm ready to answer your spatial questions.
13:41:16 USER: david can you give us a minute?
13:41:24 DAVID:  sure, let me know when you want to continue.
13:44:23 USER: so right now none of the kinect sensor should be able to see there's blood here.
13:44:48 USER: or maybe they've been out of their own memory.
13:45:10 USER:  as long as you don't move the invisible block.
13:46:18 USER: now is greater than you block.
13:46:28 USER:  assume there's a new block appeared here, but this bucket thinks it's still there.
13:46:33 USER:  so that spatial relations and
13:46:41 USER: that would relate to david understanding.
13:46:48 USER:  trying to communicate them back.
13:47:10 USER:  there's one.
13:47:20 USER:  now is that!
13:47:29 USER:  so basically
13:47:37 USER: it would like to be able.
13:47:52 USER:  this block is multiple left with them.
13:47:59 USER:  ask like whoa.
13:48:17 USER:  is the starbucks block van to the writer in this case and if you ask
13:48:24 USER:  which blocks are to the right of the mexican border?
13:48:47 USER: because it's too far and they're like many blocks that are better candidates nationwide system of the judgment and you should be able to ask above the judge.
13:48:50 USER:  so
13:48:55 USER:  one of the things you're going to be working next few weeks.
13:49:09 USER:  okay, there is a
13:49:15 USER:  council of library
13:49:19 USER:  so this will be the library of the primitive constructs.
13:49:36 USER: memorial library
13:49:40 USER:  plus
13:49:44 USER:  schemas
13:49:48 USER:  for multiple
13:49:51 USER:  concepts
13:50:03 USER:  stacks and rolls in what mountain chain
13:50:07 USER:  the notion of a
13:50:37 USER: then there is a
13:50:45 USER:  construction planning
13:50:52 USER:  and you have the definition of aspect.
13:50:55 USER:  general description
13:50:58 USER:  james substeps
13:51:16 USER: these are things out. so for now.
13:51:20 USER:  is that block a big area?
13:51:34 USER:  so you might want to think and pick whatever area you like more.
13:51:37 USER:  stop
13:51:40 USER:  is going to be mostly python and blender programming.
13:51:43 USER:  this will be
13:51:47 USER:  mixed python for lisp after the recorder thing.
13:51:51 USER:  the rest is mostly covered in, georgia.
13:52:03 USER:  apostolic logic meaning which language
13:52:18 USER: construction rules
13:52:23 USER:  and then all the mlp is list.
13:53:00 USER:  because lynn wanted to have like a unified framework for reasoning. so yeah, everything related to like like a high-level and planning construction planning everything else tracking spatial reasoning far and there is a subsystem after is the bible manager does everything else.
13:53:06 USER: management in future red will also be above in construction planning.
13:53:20 USER:  and then i guess blender unity are these things that are there like own ide interface series that is that already like
13:53:32 USER:  i guess just like the languages blender uses.
13:53:54 USER:  is there a is there like a paper on during like pre-existing literature? i may be able to all right. yeah, i will i will block into all of these hands.
13:53:56 USER:  sort of
13:54:07 USER: take note. i'm blocking through all this.
13:54:19 USER:  oh, yes, i'll cram. i need to submit the
13:54:40 USER:  yeah, it's it's working again.
13:54:43 USER:  you block nice.

09:38:09 USER: so people who sent out the blocks they decided to like phantom with different.
09:38:20 DAVID:  YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT SOME BLOCKS , BUT I DIDN'T CATCH WHAT IT WAS.
09:38:21 USER:  so they ended.
09:38:29 DAVID:  I DIDN'T CATCH WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO.

09:38:44 USER: david can you give us a minute?
09:38:54 DAVID:  SURE, LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU WANT TO CONTINUE.
09:39:01 USER: so
09:39:13 USER: what reacts to what is the leftmost flop openings on?
09:39:26 USER:  the starbucks because it's slightly left her than this one or it will say that nothing is but let's see.
09:39:44 USER:  oh, so.
09:39:59 USER:  but the problem is not always recoverable. so right now so we have like several components in our system. so there's a difference.
09:40:13 USER: so the way i'm sending the block moves right now, they are like two moves happened between your two questions.
09:40:21 USER:  and let's ask above the left one block.
09:40:55 USER:  story plot events in lake high level way in terms of like what happened in the world and there is a state wrecker which stores things in a low-level format. so basically just take a snapshot of the positions at the time.
09:40:59 USER: when you
09:41:46 USER:  information above the car with block coordinates and information above the moves that happened for the dallas manager determines with high-level them. however, so if you have a few more block ask something then move another block and ask something then those two moves they will arrive like consecutively in the stumble know that they have another block. if you have to question, then you move one bowl then you move a second block and then you ask another question those two moves. they will be sent in an orderly touching between those two blocks removed, but it doesn't know yet in what order of every month.
09:42:04 USER: is that block blocking for just the symbol itself on the block or recognizes?
09:42:09 USER:  i did it.
09:42:25 USER:  so the reason why we started in this specific configuration is that the tracking system doesn't know that this is a target for so what we do is we stocking for three configuration so that we can label we know that okay the first and then as we move them around
09:43:05 USER: so you can see here. so the tracking system only maintain what positions he doesn't see what blocks are arby's and maintain a set of identical if i could see some ghosts the phantom blood here, which doesn't exist.
09:43:40 USER:  i know this is a you mean like why there is a block up there right now because there is no problem at all like whatever block cuz i thought would be like in the front. so the vision system again. we have a separate video system in a separate modem this visual noise. so because the
09:44:02 USER: the tracking system is so imperfect. we have to kind of create a filter or a rapper which remodels whatever system sees in blender and we try to filter out all the garbage as he's like mental model.
09:44:28 USER:  either either or he will say that there's no such poor because like they were two very close candidate. so, let's see.

17:18:27 USER: yes parser died.
17:18:50 USER:  some of his work went into this. he doesn't work specific on the blocks were some of the parson capability his quarters were using
17:18:57 USER:  one of the major issues in this particular case.
17:19:15 USER:  the parcel was not able to process it because we cannot get an ulcer shelf new world trade parser.
17:19:24 USER: and it's very brittle because of this.
17:19:28 USER:  vdof cornet
17:19:34 USER:  so your van is like adding additional rules. he's trying to make it more general.
17:19:49 USER:  so is that block going from speech recognition through the parser?
17:19:58 USER:  what is printed area should the record of the person?
17:20:05 USER:  so this is the year that is produced by the parson.
17:20:10 USER:  is that generated from the parsed?
17:20:20 USER: which like this thing? so this is the output of the sr.
17:21:05 USER:  i don't know if this is the right. so at a certain point gets the transcript of your of your speech and sends it to the forester foster tries to force it and i'll put this thing as a facial system tries to work on the left. it's busy for the parts are advised to like satisfying the constraint so that it goes through the 11th the price to get on the blue blocks from the set of all the objects and set it like a result of spatial relations.
17:21:24 USER: 11:10 p.m. for back to the dialog manager witch based on the answer set. so just sent the favors of like target near toyota and the confidence level toyota near mcdonalds confidence level and from these answer sets that would you construct
17:21:29 USER:  surface-level answer
17:21:47 USER:  man, this is intense. there's a lot of back-and-forth and because we have like so many components and each component has like a certain failure probability.
17:22:00 USER:  the tracking is actually.
17:22:31 USER: tracking system so it doesn't know which block is where it only can see the block is in that location on the table. so basically there was a block there another isn't and it converts that to digest the block that that block is the one that moved. yes. so that's that's what i do know, there's a block up in this place and from that i try to infer which block it is.
17:22:56 USER: physical so that's why we start to like we always start with a specific configuration. so like it's always good two block at starbucks twitter blocks with starting the line so we know which blocks are in the beginning as you move them. that's why i asked people to move one block at a time. so the second system can't like
17:23:21 USER: what block is on each of these? i don't think it has a sensor to read these blocks. i didn't technically connect do have like there to be covering. it is possible. that's true.
17:23:29 USER:  which would have been surprising given all the blocks on each side or like different colors and different formats?
17:23:36 USER:  i mean you could really wanted to just like a bunch of photos.
17:23:43 USER:  how old is size positions?
17:23:48 USER:  i don't know.
17:23:53 USER:  i'm a little confused as where you're in. alfie comes in.
17:23:58 USER: so
17:24:08 USER:  my northeast mostly it's not you are now pi work of the spatial cognition so i can assure relations abstracted down to
17:24:27 USER:  the language is the abstract representation of facts above the world. as long as a representation is formal enough. you can go up to language in fact.
17:24:38 USER:  there's one intermediate thing language is not their presentation of the world. but rather is a representation of our internal model of the world.
17:24:46 USER:  it's kind of a two hops away from reality and you need to know the motor.
17:25:12 USER: i think we should sell under specified meaning so when you hear a sentence, that's right. it triggers the computer mechanism in your head that jump over the wall right in your head. you can take a picture this thing, you know, alexa and a sentence of the treaty of your internal representation.
17:25:21 USER:  that allows you to understand the meaning. so some people say that.
17:25:26 USER:  intrigued
17:25:31 USER:  yep. yep.
17:25:36 USER:  man, i'm glad i'm not a glad i haven't removed from this.
17:25:41 USER:  this is basically.
17:26:37 USER: little fun technical like an old boring kind of engineering challenges the difference. are y'all all the differences in the big difference between feel like if you go from systems to ai you're going from rather like systems the key thing there is out there all above. hey, can we improve efficiency? can we make things to improve security? they've got like metroid, so they're trying to improve and then you go down an ai and they're also trying to improve metrics of accuracy interpretability. they've got like general metrics of hey, we want to improve these metrics. can we make this system work better? if we run faster they more efficiently or more accurately stuff like that and then you drop down to hdi and it seemed as though
17:27:16 USER: what are metrics are human centered metric? can we see some improvement in the human? can we get the humans experience to be better? i can we help a human do x y and z human center for everything. i've done it so i can a human be more creative can humans be better at debate. can we understand? why can we explain why the human made a mistake in their judgment, can we help a human become a better speaker do better in interviews to all the metrics that we try and measure humanmetrics. we're evaluating humans.
17:27:31 USER: verses like i like the work i did in undergrad then like research project was recommender systems, and i had a dating site and i just said, joe nice and clean and
17:27:56 USER: how much nicer because like when i was trying to evaluate my the spatial relations system, which is supposed to kind of mimic human usage. it was really weird because i don't really agree or like certain things like for example to say what is new. what is right people have like dessert ideas.
17:28:26 USER:  okay, let me know again just like a bunch of people inside of every the results block a clear metric. that's why i appreciate it. but it's also a ci husband niceness of being like a superhero.
17:28:41 USER: yeah, i'm doing something that has a direct relevance to a person and i'm trying to optimize my relevance essentially other than trying to optimize how well i do at a specific task.
17:29:19 USER:  that might not ever see that people might not ever see even systems when they came up with this system works faster by great. i will take that as an ai writer and i will absorb it into my auger then right now my algorithm block smaller.
